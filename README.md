## Work Experience 

**Jr. Business Development and Operations Manager @Pipeline.gg**
(_May 2022 - March 2023_)
- Utilized data-driven approaches to generate and monitor KPIs aligned with business objectives, providing leadership with real-time insights for agile decision-making and strategy adjustments.
- Conducted in-depth customer behavior analysis, leading to a 3x increase in website conversion rates and a 50% boost in weekly new visitors by aligning business value propositions with customer pain points.
- Streamlined operations by simplifying tasks and creating an accessible "how-to" database. This initiative freed up 20% of team time, reduced processing times by up to 80%, and nurtured task ownership, enhancing overall efficiency.
- Led the analysis and optimization of marketing opportunities with strategic partners, generating over $100,000 in revenue by leveraging data insights to identify high-potential collaborations.

**Business Development Program Coordinator @Pipeline.gg (_August 2021 - May 2022_)** 
- Spearheaded our partnership with Facebook Gaming, recruiting a diverse cohort of creators through strategic categorization and persuasive outreach, leading to the generation of over $USD 600,000 in revenue.
- Devised a system to streamline tracking of our expanding Facebook Gaming creator program. Automating progress updates and minimizing errors, leading to a 3x improvement in processing efficiency.
- Analyzed gaming trends and performance metrics of new game developments, leading to a twofold increase in creator acquisitions.

**Co-Founder & Head of Business Development @Sightseeing Lisbon (_June 2018 - March 2020_)**
- Integrated social campaigns into tourism routes, allocating 20% of revenue to causes like rehabilitation and women empowerment. This approach generated over 10,000 euros, built partnerships with academic institutions, and increased awareness of sustainability in tourism.
- Validated our business concept through iterative testing. Using a mix of cold and warm outreach, I successfully connected with leading European tourism universities known for travel-related education programs.

### Data Science Projects
